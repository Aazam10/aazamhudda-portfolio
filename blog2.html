        <h1>DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL</h1>
        <p class="blog-para">In this blog I will be writing about the document object model popularly known as the
            DOM.Everything we do to interact with the browser is governed by the document object model.It is at the
            heart of web page manipulation.</p>
        <h2>WHAT IS DOM?</h2>
        <p class="blog-para">
            It is created by the browser when a HTML document loads inside it.Once the HTML document is loaded in the
            browser the browser creates an object which models this document and this object is called Document Object
            Model (DOM).
        </p>
        <p class="blog-para">Document object model describes our html page as a hierarchical tree of nodes.If we want to
            interact with a web page we would use DOM to reach into this tree of nodes and we would get reference to
            this node and when we get a reference to that node we can use different methods to manipulate the document
            object.</p>
        <h2>PROPERTIES AND METHODS</h2>
        <p class="blog-para">We do have access to a lot of properties and methods on this document object so what are
            properties and methods.</p>
        <h3>Property</h3>
        <p class="blog-para">A property is a value that you can get or set (like changing content of an html element.)
        </p>
        <h3>Method</h3>
        <p class="blog-para">Method is an action that you can do on the referenced element like add or delete HTML
            element.
        </p>
        <h2>QUERYING THE DOM</h2>
        <p class="blog-para">We query the DOM to get reference on the elements on which we want to use properties or use
            a method so we can either change its content or add or delete HTML elements
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Grab an element by ID:</h3>We can use the method getElementById which takes in the Id of an element
                as
                parameter to select an element with a unique id that returns a single element.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Grab an element by Class name:</h3> If we want to grab multiple elements we can grab them using
                getElementsByClassName .This takes the class name as parameter and returns HTML Collection. We can grab
                a single element using square brackets.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Grab an element by tag name:</h3> We can also get reference to the elements using their tag names.
                The method
                used for this is getElementsByTagName and takes the tag name as a parameter and returns a HTML
                Collection.
            </li>

        </ol>
        <h2>Using The Query Selector and Query SelectorAll Methods.</h2>
        <p class="blog-para">Apart from the above mentioned ways we can also query the DOM using querySelector and
            querySelectorAll methods.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>QuerySelector method:</h3>This returns a single element and takes in id,class name or tag as a
                parameter. To give id as a parameter we need to use # before the name of the id, to give the class name
                as parameter we need to give . before the name of the class and if the class has multiple elements it
                will return the first element with that class name.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>QuerySelectorAll:</h3> This is similar to query selector but is primarily used when we have to grab
                multiple elements using the class name. This returns a nodeList when we query using the class name and
                every element can be grabbed using the square bracket notation and we can also use the forEach method on
                node LIst unlike the HTML Collection.
            </li>
        </ol>
