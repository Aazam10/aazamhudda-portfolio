        <h1>Thinking With Tanay Feat. ABHIK MITRA</h1>
        <p class="blog-para">This blog is about Tanay Pratap’s podcast “Thinking With Tanay”. This blog will cover his
            conversation with Abhik Mitra. The podcast was published in May of 2020 and was a 5 part series but in this
            blog we will be covering the first 3 episodes of the podcast in which we will get to know about Abhik’s
            journey from a service based company which was Infosys to a startup which is now a household name in
            India,Flipkart.
        </p>
        <h2>ABHIK’S BACKGROUND</h2>
        <p class="blog-para">Abhik did his engineering from Heritage Institute of Technology,Kolkata in Information
            Technology. He got placement in more than one service based company but chose Infosys.
            But during his interview experience with all these service based companies he was shocked that he wasn’t
            asked a single question about coding.

        </p>
        <h2>MAKING YOUR SERVICE JOB WORK FOR YOU?</h2>
        <p class="blog-para">In this section I will be writing about the advice that Abhik gave to people working in
            service based companies and how they can better utilise their time at these companies.</p>
        <p class="blog-para">First advice that he gave was to distance yourself from your friends in college and he gave
            a very solid reason for this that if you stay around the same people in your college and company you will
            not be able to grow.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-para">Second advice that he gave was to cultivate a community which aligns with your interests.
            Try and change your city so you will have a lot of time to explore things which excite you and things that
            you want to do.</p>
        <p class="blog-para">Third advice he gave was to spend some money on courses so that you become serious about
            doing those things.Just because you have spent money you will start going through the course he said.</p>

        <h2>BENCH TIME IN SERVICE BASED COMPANIES</h2>
        <p class="blog-para">When asked about bench time in these companies Abhi replied that all hope is not lost when
            you are on bench and one should utilise this time effectively.
            Decide what you want to do and go for it 100% if you want to go for CAT go for it.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-para">
            Bench time is the time to go and build your skills.There will be a lot of people who will be doubting you
            asto why he is studying even after having a job but you need to study like you are preparing for an entrance
            exam and study things that you are passionate about.
        </p>
        <h3>His time on bench at Infosys</h3>
        <p class="blog-para">He was not 100% sure what he wanted to do so he started writing blogs on Computer Vision.
            He
            took his final year project and extended it and started working on OpenCV for quite some time and thought to
            himself if he can get a job in a role related to OpenCV it would be awesome,.He also created some apps in
            windows using .NET.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-para">He was given a chance to work in a maintenance project after he was trained again to be a
            database admin but he rejected that and chose to stay on bench as he had no interest in that and struggled
            with it.</p>
        <p class="blog-para">He then started looking into Infosys intraweb network and came across a portal where folks
            would post small modules that they wanted to build.He started searching for .NET roles and started reaching
            out to people for those projects. He then started to ping folks from Infosys Labs a product arm of infosys
            and gave them reasons why he would be a great fit for their team.He sent them links to his blog and also the
            apps he had released on windows.
            What he was trying was to show them that he was passionate and in his free time he had worked on things that
            aligned with his interest.
        </p>
        <h2>INFOSYS LABS</h2>
        <p class="blog-para">He then joined Infosys Labs and started working on a frontend project on WiFi
            Triangulation. He finally started coding in the office.Started doing some more courses one of which was a
            Coursera course called Startup Engineering Course which taught how to set up MongoDB and setting your
            website.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-para">He also started reading about JavaScript. He used to spend a lot of time in the office
            doing his work and the rest reading about JavaScript.He also wrote the questions that came to his mind and
            researched them to find their answers.

        </p>
        <p class="blog-para">He was also implementing the stuff he learned in his office project and when his office
            folks found out he was really passionate about this he got a lot of autonomy.

            Now he had started to give interviews in other companies and was looking for a switch.

        </p>
        <h2>INSPIRATION TO SWITCH JOBS</h2>
        <p class="blog-para">Abhik says he was always seeking out opportunities to code and that was very limited in
            Infosys. He found out that the opportunity to code was in Product based companies so the goal was if he can
            code in those companies lets go and join them. His inspiration was to always code at better places.</p>
        <h2>INTERVIEWING AT START-UPS</h2>
        <p class="blog-para">One and a half years later his bond with In fosys was done and he started thinking about
            interviewing at different places. He wrote a three page long CV which he didn’t recommend to anyone and said
            to keep it short and precise but at the same time his CV was being short-listed because he had a bunch of
            blogs and projects under his belt.</p>
        <p class="blog-para">He started getting calls from other service based companies and for the first time he went
            through a proper coding round. He got a job at one of these companies as L2 support analyst but declined
            that offer as he wanted to work somewhere where he can code on a daily basis despite the fact that they were
            ready to double his salary at which point our host Tanay is a little shocked and asks Abhik about his
            parent’s view on him declining the job to which he replied that they were a bit surprised but were always
            supportive. </p>
        <p class="blog-para">So now he knew that he could crack service based companies and knew he should start
            applying to product based companies but he waited for 3 more months and did his office work and worked on
            his JavaScript skills.
        </p>
        <h2>INTERVIEWS AT PRODUCT BASED STARTUPS</h2>
        <p class="blog-para">Now Abhik started interviewing at product based companies he even got into one but again
            rejected it and this time the reason was not because he wouldn’t get to code but because the job was in
            Hyderabad and he knew that the community was taking off in bangalore and he wanted to be a part of it so he
            declined the job offer that was ready to triple his salary.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-para">After rejecting this company he applied at flipkart and started preparing methodically for
            the interview. First round was the machine coding round which he thought didn’t go well but the company
            liked it.</p>
        <p class="blog-para">After this he had a skype call and had three or four rounds of interviews in Bangalore and
            he got the job at Flipkart.</p>
        <h2>HELPFUL INSIGHTS FROM THIS 3 PARTS FOR ANYONE WANTING TO GET INTO A GOOD STARTUP</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>When you code whatever you have learnt it gets into your me</li>
            <li>You become like the people you interact with.</li>
            <li>Accept the fact that people won’t understand what you are doing and why you are doing it.</li>
            <li> Always seek out opportunities to code at better places where you get autonomy for your work and you are
                responsible for whatever you do good or bad and not your manager.</li>
            <li> During your interview with a company, never ask how you did, instead ask the interviewer to recommend
                some material that you can go through so that you can learn more about the specific technology.</li>
        </ol>
